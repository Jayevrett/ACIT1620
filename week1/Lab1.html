<h2>Patterns in Counter-Strike</h2>

<p>What is a pattern? Pattern is a texture, from which are some of the skins randomly generated. What the game does is move the skin up/down/left/righ in any direction, thus making it look different. So this is the reason why two skins with same quality and exterior can look different from each other.

<h2>Wear and Tear on Skins in Counter-Strike</h2>

<p>
In Counter-Strike, every skin that you can apply to a weapon has a float value. This value is a number ranging from 0 to 1, which determines the skin's wear level or condition. The float value is a crucial factor that affects the skin's appearance and, consequently, its desirability and market value.
